# Generative Adversarial Networks for Data Augmentation and Domain Adaptation

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based system for data augmentation and domain adaptation in a chosen domain. The project is part of the "Machine Learning for Visual & Multimedia" course.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a GAN-based system to augment a limited dataset in a selected domain (e.g., medical imaging, remote sensing, gesture recognition, defect inspection, or any other domain of choice). The goal is to generate realistic synthetic data that enhances the performance of downstream models in classification or detection tasks, particularly when dealing with scarce or imbalanced training data.

A secondary objective is to explore domain adaptation techniques between real and synthetic data to improve the generalization capabilities of the classifier. This includes addressing domain shift issues during training and testing, potentially using a different target domain as the test set.

## Dataset

The dataset can be collected ad hoc or sourced from a public repository containing a small-scale, domain-specific dataset. Key requirements and documentation include:

### Dataset Specifications
- **Class Labels and Data Source**: Clearly define the class labels and specify the origin of the data (e.g., public repository name, collection method).
- **Dataset Statistics**:
  - Counts per class
  - Imbalance ratio
  - Distribution characteristics (e.g., mean, variance, skewness)
- **Domain Characteristics**: Document the specific characteristics of the chosen domain, including data modalities, typical challenges, and relevant features.
- **Augmentation Scope**: Define the intended scope of augmentation, such as:
  - Intra-class diversity enhancement
  - Dataset balancing to address class imbalance
  - Generation of edge cases or rare scenarios

### Dataset Structure
The final dataset must include:
1. **Reduced Baseline Subset**: A smaller subset for initial experiments to establish baseline performance.
2. **Augmented Version**: The baseline dataset enriched with synthetic data generated by the GAN.
3. **Domain Adaptation Dataset** (optional): A third dataset from a different domain to test generalization and domain adaptation capabilities.

## Experimental Plan

The project is structured into three main phases:

### Phase 1: Baseline Classifier Training and Evaluation
- Train and evaluate a classifier (e.g., CNN or transformer-based model) on the reduced baseline dataset.
- Record key performance metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - F1-score
  - Confusion matrices
- Analyze and quantify the limitations imposed by data scarcity, such as overfitting, poor generalization, or biased predictions.

### Phase 2: GAN Implementation and Synthetic Data Generation
- Implement and train a GAN architecture suitable for the chosen domain.
- Generate synthetic samples that closely mimic the real data distribution.
- Perform evaluation of the synthetic data:
  - **Qualitative Evaluation**: Visual inspection, comparison with real samples, assessment of realism.
  - **Quantitative Evaluation**: Statistical measures (e.g., Fréchet Inception Distance - FID, Inception Score), distribution similarity metrics.

### Phase 3: Augmented Training and Domain Adaptation
- Retrain the same classifier from Phase 1 on the augmented dataset (combining real and synthetic data).
- Compare performance metrics with Phase 1 results to assess the impact of GAN-based augmentation.
- Optionally, implement adversarial domain adaptation techniques to:
  - Reduce domain shift effects
  - Improve generalization across different domains
  - Evaluate performance on a separate target domain test set

## Implementation Details

### Technologies and Libraries
- Python
- PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning implementation
- GAN frameworks (e.g., DCGAN, WGAN, StyleGAN depending on domain requirements)
- Computer vision libraries (OpenCV, PIL)
- Data analysis and visualization (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
