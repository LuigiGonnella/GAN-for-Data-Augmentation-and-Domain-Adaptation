this was the first run only maximizing recall but then we changed:
Done! The accuracy threshold is now active:

Changes Made:

Model saves only when: recall improves AND accuracy > 30%
Warning message when recall improves but accuracy too low
Updated logging to show both recall and accuracy when saving
What This Prevents:

Epoch 20: Recall=1.0, Accuracy=0.131 → ⚠️ Won't save (accuracy < 30%)
Epoch 7: Recall=0.95, Accuracy=0.181 → ⚠️ Won't save (accuracy < 30%)
What This Allows:

Models with good balance (recall ≥ 0.85, accuracy > 30%)
The 30% threshold is conservative - it still allows high recall priority while filtering out completely pathological models.
